# Student Record Management System (C++ with Singly Linked List)

## Description:
This project is a console-based Student Record Management System implemented in C++. It uses a singly linked list to manage student data, including features such as adding, deleting, updating, and displaying student records. Each record consists of a student ID, name, and GPA.

---

## Features:

- **Add Student**: Adds a new student to the beginning of the list. If a student with the same ID already exists, the user is prompted to update the record instead.

- **Remove Student**: Deletes a student record by their unique ID.

- **Find Student**: Searches for a student using their ID and displays the information.

- **Display All Students**: Displays the list of all students along with their ID, name, and GPA.

- **Update Student Info**: Allows updating a student’s name, GPA, or both.

- **Sort by GPA**: Sorts the linked list of students in ascending order based on GPA.

- **Count Students**: Displays the total number of students in the system.

- **Input Validation**: Ensures users input valid choices during interactions.

## Data Structure Used:

**Singly Linked List**:  
Each node contains a student’s information and a pointer to the next node. It supports dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion.

---

## Key Concepts Demonstrated:

- Linked list operations (insert, delete, search, traverse, sort)  
- Object-Oriented Programming in C++ (classes, encapsulation, dynamic memory)  
- Input validation and user-friendly menu-driven interface  
- Function overloading for updating records (name, GPA, or both)  
- Use of `getline`, `cin`, and `cin.ignore()` for input handling  

---

## Technologies Used:

- **Language**: C++  
- **Platform**: Command-line (terminal/console)  
- **Tools**: Any C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Code::Blocks, Visual Studio)
